# MACE
### SOFWERX Cyber Security project is called MACE (Military Applications of Cyber Effects)

This project is based upon the following assumptions:

   1. SOF forces of the future will operate in ultra-dense urban environments (i.e., Brazilian favelas, New Delhi, etc.)

   2. Based on assumption 1, space-based assets will not be able to penetrate to the ground to provide the required intelligence.

   3. Based on assumption 1, deployment of munitions from air assets will result in an unacceptable collateral damage estimate.

   4. The second and third world will adapt Internet of Things (IoT) and ICS/SCADA faster than the U.S. due to an absence of legacy infrastructure.

   5. Based on assumptions 1 & 4, the electromagnetic environment will present particular challenges to tradition RF capabilities such as terrestrial radio.

   6. Based upon assumption 1, 4, 5, satellite communications will also be unsuitable due to a lack of ability to see the horizon without making our operatorsâ€™ significant targets.

#### These assumptions require a re-examination of capabilities that are typically provided by support elements. Our operators need to be able to:

   1. Conduct a rapid survey of both physical and electromagnetic space

   2. Quickly assess, map, and integrate knowledge gained from step 1 in order to provide offensive, defensive and support capabilities based on the physical an EM environment. These capabilities include a necessity to visualize large amounts of information in coordination with geographic location in a GPS-degraded or denied environment.

   3. Conduct operations in ultra-dense urban environments while taking advantage of embedded capabilities and opportunities already present in the environment. These capabilities need to be employed with a minimum of operator interaction and must rely on new methods of information visualization and non-traditional human-computer interfaces.

### Phase-1: establish and populate a Device Signature Repository

#### Query device characteristics based on combination of device signatures from multiple domains (ie. cyber, radio frequency, physical)

   * Identify devices based on images from a Drone

   * Identify devices based on RF Signals

   * Identify devices based on Cyber Information

   * Identify devices from combination of domains

#### Create a database that stores characteristics for each device
